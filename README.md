# The Platform for Inductive Experiments over Medical Data (PIE MD)
This repository contains the dataset, task, model training recipes, and results for the PIE MD benchmarking
effort for EHR machine learning. See [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s-AR0qfoPmwJW4G7cIxdV6Z_cSEDGUir9BhO92Vb3wo/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.

Note that this repository is _not_ a place where functional code is stored. Rather, this repository stores
configuration files, training recipes, results, etc. for the PIE MD benchmarking effort -- runnable code will
often come from other repositories, with suitable permalinks being present in the various configuration files
or commit messages for associated contributions to this repository.
