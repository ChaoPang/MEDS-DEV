# Datasets

This folder contains details for datasets currently included in the MEDS-DEV effort.

TODO: More details.

## Notes

If you have a version of a task configuration file that is more specialized to a dataset than can be achieved
with overwriting the predicates alone, then (1) make a GitHub issue explaining why the existing file is not
used, and (2) add a file here `../tasks/$DATASET_NAME/$TASK_NAME.yaml` with that configuration.
