# PIE MD Supported Tasks

In these subdirectories, we store the task configuration files (see [this
tool](https://github.com/justin13601/ESGPTTaskQuerying/) for the task configuration language) that are used in
PIE MD.

See [this google
sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uOlV0RpuhWLXkhlc_aG4raYO6gnjTrQVHHH1H_r6sLg/edit?usp=sharing)
for another view of the supported tasks.

The format here is `dataset_name/task_name.yaml` where `dataset_name` is the name of the dataset and
`task_name` is the name of the task. tasks can be nested, realized as simply including "`/`"s in their names.
