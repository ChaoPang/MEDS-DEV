description: >-
  This task predicts whether the patient will have high _WBC_ values (leukocytosis) within the next 24
  hours, given the first 24 hours of their admission to the ICU. To be included, patients must have
  at least one measurement for _WBC_ within the next 24 hours after their admission to ICU,
  and their length of stay in ICU should be at least 24 hours.
