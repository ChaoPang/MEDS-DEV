# New Dataset Template
This is a template for creating a new dataset in MEDS-DEV. The dataset should be stored in a directory named after the dataset in the `src/MEDS-DEV/datasets` directory.

## Description
Describe the dataset in a few sentences. A link to the dataset's homepage and/or repository or a research paper is recommended.

## Access Requirements
Describe any access requirements for the dataset (e.g, human species research). If the dataset is publicly available, state that here. If the dataset is not publicly available, describe the process for obtaining access. We recommend the following topics be covered:
- **Access Policy**: Describe the access policy for the dataset, including any restrictions or permissions required.
- **License (for files)**: Specify the license under which the dataset files are distributed.
- **Data Use Agreement**: Specify any data use agreement that must be signed to access the dataset.
- **Required training**: Specify any training or certification required to access the dataset.

## Supported Tasks
Describe the existing tasks already present in MEDS-DEV that are covered. If there are new tasks that can be added, describe them here. Also note the `predicates.yaml` file that specifies the dataset's predicates.

## MEDS-transformation
Shortly specify the process of transforming this dataset to the MEDS format. If the dataset is already in the MEDS format when downloaded, specify that here.

## Sources

Summarize the sources of the dataset. If the dataset is a combination of multiple sources, list them here.
