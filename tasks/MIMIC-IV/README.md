# Tasks For MIMIC-IV

This contains task realizations for MIMIC-IV. It is comprised of two components:
  1. A file `predicates.yaml`, which contains all the plain predicates in MIMIC-IV used across all included
     tasks, and
  2. A collection of other directories mirroring the structure of `../criteria` with copies of those
     configuration files realized over the `MIMIC-IV` predicates.

The particular MIMIC-IV cohort used for these tasks is 2.2. It is produced using the MEDS pipeline accessible
