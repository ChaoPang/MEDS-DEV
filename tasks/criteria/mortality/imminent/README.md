# Imminent Mortality Prediction
Here, we focus on tasks for predicting on unconditioned mortality within upcoming, usually short time-frames.
This can be used as a signal for acute decompensation events in an inpatient setting, warranting immediate
clinical attention, or as general risk proxies in outpatient settings, though the intervention surfaces differ
greatly in each and warrant careful consideration.
