# Discharge Prediction

This folder contains tasks relating to predicting a patient's likelihood of discharge within select
time-frames. This task can be useful either for patient-flow optimization (e.g. predicting which beds are
likely to be available by a given time) or as a counterpart to tasks like mortality prediction to obtain a
more expressive probabilistic prediction on a patient's state (e.g., if you have in-hospital data only, model
predictions about patient outcomes may be only valid in regions when the patient is unlikely to be imminently
discharged to avoid censoring).

We break down discharge prediction into both hospital discharge and ICU discharge, but more may be added in
the future.
